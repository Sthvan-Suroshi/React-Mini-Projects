# Review Stars

The Review Stars project is a simple web application that allows users to rate items using a star-based system commonly seen on e-commerce websites. Users can hover over the stars to select a rating from 1 to 5 stars, and their selection is visually reflected in real-time.

The developer has option to change the number of stars displayed by changing the `no_of_stars` prop.
